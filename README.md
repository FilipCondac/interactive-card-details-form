Frontend Mentor Challange: Interactive Card details form(React, Typescript, Tailwind CSS) ðŸ§¨

This is a website I created that displays the input information of the user on the card. It helped me practice my useContext skills and gave me better understanding of the hook. It also gave me a better understanding of how to place elements on a page so that they can efficiently be scaled.

This is a small project which helped me practice using this stack.
